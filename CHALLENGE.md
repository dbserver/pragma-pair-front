# Original Code Challenge
 
# Introduction
Our feature teams are facing a huge problem. Since our teams are very democratic, every single day they spend about 30 minutes debating and trying to decide where to go for lunch.
Let's build a small application and help them decide in an easier and faster way.

## Instructions
- Source code has to implement the client/server approach where:
  - Server-side is written in ​Node.js​.
  - Client-side is written in ​AngularJS​.
  - Visual layout is not important and does not need to be customized in any
way.
- It is not required to use a database server, just make your app mock the data
you will need internally in any of the application layers.
- All user stories must be implemented with an acceptable level of automated
tests.
- When you're done, send us a zip file with your code, or send us a link where we
can download the package from.
- Make sure your package contains a readme file with any relevant information
you deem necessary to run your project, and also including:
  - What are the highlights of your logic/code writing style?
  - What could have been done in a better way?
  - Any other notes you judge relevant for the evaluation of your project.
- You will be given a deadline by your Pragmateam/DBServer contact, and you need to return this code challenge by the end of day of such deadline (yes, you have until 23:59:59 to do that).

## Some tips
- We know there are some business rules missing in this challenge and it's ok for you to make some reasonable assumptions.
- Don't gold plate the solution. Focus on the user stories and, if you have some time left, feel free to improve the UI or add some other feature you feel could be valuable.

# User stories

## User story 1
As a ​hungry worker,
I want to ​vote on my favourite restaurant,
So that ​I can democratically convince my colleagues to come have lunch with me at places I like.

## Acceptance criteria
- Users can only cast one vote per restaurant per day. 

## User story 2
As a ​voting process facilitator,
I want to ​avoid going to the same restaurant on the same week, So that ​there are no complaints from other colleagues.

## Acceptance criteria
- A restaurant cannot be chosen more than once on the same week.

## User story 3
As a ​hungry worker,
I want to ​know before noon what was the chosen restaurant, So that ​me and my stomach can prepare ourselves.

## Acceptance criteria
- Show somehow the results of the voting.
