# code-challenge
This is a DB Server and PragmaTeam pair-programming code challenge.

## What's this application?
This repository contains the frontend part of a voting facilitator tool for lunch, developed in AngularJS. We will work together to make some improvements on it and, of course, have some fun as well.
